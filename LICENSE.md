Horse64 Logo license
---------------------

Horse64 Logo is Copyright (C)  2020, ellie/@ell1e. All Rights Reserved.

The "Horse64 Logo"'s files are located in `misc/` with the filenames starting
with "logo".
The Horse64 Logo and its files may only be used in the official, unmodified
"Horse64" as maintained by Ellie June at `https://github.com/horse64/horse64`,
and at `https://horse64.org/download`.
**If you distribute modified versions of Horse64, don't use
the Horse64 Logo and please don't use the official name "Horse64" either.**
Temporary forks only made for the personal use of preparing
pull requests for the official "Horse64" are fine, of course.
